# Data_Visualisation_Maternal_Mortality
I employed data visualization techniques to delve into the root causes of maternal mortality in countries grappling with significant challenges in this area. Through visual representations, I highlighted the disparities in these contributory factors between nations that have made commendable strides in tackling maternal mortality and those encountering difficulties. 
This endeavor underscores my proficiency in utilizing R and showcases my ability to employ data visualizations as a powerful tool for accentuating critical insights.
